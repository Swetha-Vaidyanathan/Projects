### Hierarchical Clustering on Socioeconomic Data

This project implements hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) on a dataset of socioeconomic indicators from various countries. The objective is to cluster countries based on similarities in their socioeconomic status using six key statistics: Population, Net Migration, GDP per capita, Literacy rate, Phones per 1000, and Infant Mortality rate.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Processing:** Loaded and processed real-world socioeconomic data from a CSV file.
- **Feature Calculation:** Represented each country as a 6-dimensional feature vector based on the selected statistics.
- **Clustering Algorithm:** Implemented HAC using complete linkage to group countries with similar socioeconomic profiles.
- **Visualization:** Generated dendrograms to visually represent the hierarchical clusters.
- **Normalization:** Normalized feature vectors to ensure each statistic contributed equally to the clustering process.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

This project showcases the application of hierarchical clustering in data analysis and visualization, providing insights into the socioeconomic similarities between different countries.
