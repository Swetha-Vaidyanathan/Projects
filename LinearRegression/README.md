### Linear Regression on Lake Mendota Ice Data

This project involves performing linear regression on historical data of ice cover on Lake Mendota. The goal is to analyze trends and make predictions about the number of days the lake is covered by ice each year.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Curation:** Curated a clean dataset from raw historical data spanning from 1855 to 2022, ensuring accurate representation of the number of ice days each year.
- **Visualization:** Plotted the relationship between the year and the number of ice days to visualize trends over time.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Implemented a linear regression model to find the best-fit line representing the trend in the ice cover duration.
- **Prediction:** Used the model to predict future ice cover duration, including an analysis of the year when the lake might no longer freeze.
- **Model Interpretation:** Interpreted the model coefficients to understand the trend and its implications on the ice cover duration of Lake Mendota.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in environmental data analysis, providing insights into climate trends and their potential future impacts.
