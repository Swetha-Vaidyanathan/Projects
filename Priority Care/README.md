**Title: Priority Care Admissions - Recursive Min-Heap Magic**

**Overview:**
Welcome to Priority Care Admissions 2.0, where we take patient intake to the next level with a recursive array-based min-heap priority queue. This tool, powered by enums and thoughtful recursion, will revolutionize how the urgent care clinic handles patient prioritization. Your main tasks include implementing the PriorityCareAdmissions and PriorityCareTester, with a sprinkle of Comparable interface magic for PatientRecord.

**Project Essentials:**
1. **Enums for Triage Priority:** Instead of constants, we'll leverage the TriagePriority enum (RED, YELLOW, GREEN) to streamline the triage level management. Enums make our code cleaner and more intuitive.

2. **PatientRecord Class:** Patient records are back! You only need to implement the Comparable interface for PatientRecord. It's like giving each patient a personalized priority ticket.

3. **PriorityCareAdmissions:** The star of the show! Implement the array-based min-heap priority queue. This class manages the intake order, ensuring patients are prioritized correctly based on their triage levels.

4. **PriorityCareTester:** Your trusty sidekick! Develop robust testing methods to ensure the correctness and reliability of PriorityCareAdmissions. Smaller, atomic tests will help pinpoint any issues in your code efficiently.

**Project Breakdown:**
- **TriagePriority Enum:** Enumerate triage levels (RED, YELLOW, GREEN). Enums simplify the representation of these levels, making our code more readable.

- **Comparable Interface in PatientRecord:** Implement the Comparable interface for PatientRecord. This enables patient records to be compared and sorted based on their triage levels.

- **PriorityCareAdmissions Class:** The heart of our project! Implement the array-based min-heap priority queue. Prioritize patients efficiently, considering both triage levels and the recursive nature of the heap.

- **PriorityCareTester Class:** The vigilant guardian! Develop comprehensive tests to validate the correctness of PriorityCareAdmissions. Break down tests into smaller, focused units to quickly identify and address any issues.

**Learning Objectives:**
- **Comparable Interface Implementation:** Practice implementing the Comparable interface for efficient comparison and sorting of objects.

- **Array-Based Min-Heap:** Learn the ins and outs of building a priority queue using a recursive array-based min-heap. Prioritize elements and maintain order dynamically.

- **Recursive Thinking:** Deepen your understanding of recursive thinking by applying it to the construction and maintenance of a priority queue.

- **Exception Handling:** Revisit exception handling concepts, ensuring your code gracefully handles potential errors and edge cases.

- **Tester Methods Mastery:** Strengthen your tester methods by creating focused, atomic tests. This approach facilitates quicker error identification and resolution.
