### AI Game Player for Teeko

This project involves developing an AI game player for the game Teeko using the minimax algorithm. The goal is to create a competitive AI that can play the game optimally and make intelligent decisions based on the current state of the game.

#### Key Features:
- **Game Overview:** Teeko is a two-player game played on a 5x5 board. Players take turns placing markers with the goal of forming a line of four markers horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or in a 2x2 box.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Implemented the minimax algorithm to evaluate possible moves and choose the optimal one by simulating future game states. The algorithm uses a heuristic scoring function to evaluate non-terminal states.
- **State Representation:** Developed an internal state representation in Python, handling the game's rules and possible moves. This includes generating legal successors for a given state and evaluating their outcomes.
- **Move Evaluation:** Created a function to score each possible move based on the game's win conditions, ensuring the AI can make informed decisions.
- **Strategic Gameplay:** Ensured the AI can handle both the drop phase (placing markers) and the move phase (moving markers to adjacent spaces) of the game, optimizing for winning strategies.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Minimax Algorithm

This project demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence in game development, showcasing skills in algorithm design, state space representation, and strategic decision-making.
