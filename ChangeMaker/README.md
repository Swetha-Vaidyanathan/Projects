This project focuses on solving a variation of the change-making problem using recursion. 
Imagine being a cashier tasked with dispensing change to customers while aiming to minimize the total number of coins used. 
The challenge lies in efficiently finding a combination of coins, each with a specific denomination, that adds up to a given amount. 
Complicating the scenario, there's a limited supply of each coin denomination.
